## Introduction

Concurrency is a fundamental aspect of modern programming, enabling applications to perform multiple operations simultaneously. Whether you're developing high-performance servers, responsive user interfaces, or complex simulations, understanding concurrency is essential for building efficient and reliable software.

This README provides an overview of concurrency concepts, their importance, and introduces several classic concurrency problems implemented as practical exercises in C++. These exercises illustrate how to manage shared resources, prevent common pitfalls like deadlocks, and ensure smooth execution of concurrent tasks.

## What is Concurrency?

**Concurrency** refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. In programming, it involves structuring a program to execute multiple computations in overlapping time periods. This doesn't necessarily mean they run at the exact same instant (which would be parallelism), but that they progress independently, potentially interacting with shared resources.

Concurrency is achieved through various constructs such as threads, processes, and asynchronous programming. It allows programs to be more efficient, especially on multi-core processors, by utilizing available resources effectively.

## Why is Concurrency Important?

1. **Performance Enhancement**: Concurrency allows programs to perform multiple operations at once, improving throughput and responsiveness. For example, a web server can handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

2. **Resource Utilization**: Efficiently uses system resources like CPU and memory by performing tasks in parallel, reducing idle times.

3. **Responsiveness**: In user interfaces, concurrency ensures that the application remains responsive to user inputs while performing background tasks.

4. **Scalability**: Concurrency is crucial for applications that need to scale with increased workload, such as large-scale data processing or real-time analytics.

5. **Modeling Real-World Systems**: Many real-world systems are inherently concurrent (e.g., traffic systems, manufacturing processes), and concurrency in programming mirrors these interactions.

## Key Concurrency Concepts

### Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)

A **mutex** is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources from concurrent access. It ensures that only one thread can access the critical section of code that modifies shared data at a time, preventing race conditions.

**Usage Example:**
```cpp
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
// Critical section
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

### Deadlock

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. Deadlocks can halt program execution and are a common concurrency issue.

#### **Deadlock Conditions:**

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode.
2. **Hold and Wait:** Threads holding resources are waiting to acquire additional resources.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly removed from threads.
4. **Circular Wait:** A circular chain of threads exists, where each thread holds at least one resource needed by the next thread in the chain.

#### **Deadlock Prevention Strategies:**

- **Resource Ordering:** Assign a global order to resources and acquire them in that order.
- **Avoid Hold and Wait:** Require threads to request all needed resources at once.
- **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for resource acquisition attempts.
